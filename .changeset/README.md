# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you keep track of changes. This is a tool that helps
maintainers of open source projects.

To learn more about using Changesets, check out some of these resources:

- [Changesets Documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md)
- [How Changesets Work](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/detailed-explanation.md)

## How to Use Changesets

### Creating a Changeset

When you want to make a change to a package, run:

```bash
npm run changeset
# or
npx changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages you want to include in the changeset
2. Choose the type of change (major, minor, or patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

This creates a markdown file in `.changeset/` that describes your change.

### Releasing Changes

When you're ready to release:

1. **Version packages** (updates version numbers and generates changelogs):
   ```bash
   npm run changeset:version
   ```

2. **Publish packages** (publishes to npm):
   ```bash
   npm run changeset:publish
   ```

Or use the combined command:
```bash
npm run changeset:release
```

### Example Workflow

1. Make your code changes
2. Run `npm run changeset` to create a changeset
3. Commit the changeset file along with your code changes
4. When ready to release, run `npm run changeset:version` to bump versions
5. Review the generated changelogs
6. Run `npm run changeset:publish` to publish to npm
7. Commit the version bumps and changelogs
8. Create a git tag and push
